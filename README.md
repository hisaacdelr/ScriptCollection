# Script Collection
Collection of Bash Scripts I've Written For Personal Purposes (and your purposes I guess?)

These scripts have only been tested on Macbooks and can't guarantee they'll run the same on Windows computers (probably not but you can try? lmk how it goes ^^;)

**toggle_script.sh** : Hide your kids, hide your wife, hide your desktop icons! 
You can just put the function itself in your Mac's .bash_profile located prolly at `~/.bash_profile`
OR just source the script by going `source file_location/toggle_script.sh; show_icons`

And how you run it is by going `show_icons true` to show them or `show_icons false` to hide your desktop icons.
They still exist and you can see your hidden files via the Finder, still under your Desktop folder.
